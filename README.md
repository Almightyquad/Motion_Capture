# Motion_Capture

An application to display motion capture data. The capture data has to be in the format "x,y,z,w timestamp: timeinmillis" to work right off the bat, it can easily be changed to any format as long as you know what you are doing. To capture motion data use this application: https://github.com/Almightyquad/RotationVectorCapture/tree/master . 

Beware, you do need to have 2 motion data files for the application not to crash. But other than that you're in for a treat.
